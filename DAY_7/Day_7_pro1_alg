//Write a program to convert a data stream from Little Endian to Big Endian (you can take any 8 bit value or use 0b110101110)?
Algorithm
-> read number and consider 1 byte
-> extract least 4 bits and lest shift 4 times
-> then extract 4 bits from MSB side and right shit 4 times 
-> and add both numbers

// Write a code to swap even bits with odd bits in unsigned long variable(uint64).
Example: bit 0 with bit 1; bit 2 with bit 3; bit 4 with bit

The solution assumes that input number is stored using 64 bits.
Let the input number be x 

1) Get all even bits of x by doing bitwise and(&) of x with 0xAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. 
The number 0xAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA is a 64-bit number with all even bits set as 1 and all odd bits as 0. 

2) Get all odd bits of x by doing bitwise and of x with 0x5555555555555555. 
The number 0x5555555555555555 is a 64-bit number with all odd bits set as 1 and all even bits as 0. 

3) Right shift all even bits and store it in variable even.

4) Left shift all odd bits and store it in variable odd.

5) Combine new even and odd bits and return by bitwise oring both variables.

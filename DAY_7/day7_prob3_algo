//write program to clear(0) bits CIS, CM2, CM1, CM0 in register “CMCON” if bits CHS3, CHS2, CHS1, CHS0 bits are set to 0x07 in register “ADCON0”
1)Enter the two registers
2)read the  two registers
3)chech 5 4 3 2 bits of register “ADCON0”are equivlent to 7 or not
4)If Equal  the second register of  the first 4bit will be zero using add operation with F0
5)print the second register

 Assume that we have a car with 8 seats, and we are monitoring 8 seat belt status in a variable 
“G_Msg_switchstatus_Byte[]” as shown in pic1. Each switch status is combination of 2 bits as shown in pic2.

Write status of switches into variable “G_Msg_switchstatus_Byte[]” as below.

SWITCH1, SWITCH7 status is “faulty type 1 in switch”, 
SWITCH2, SWITCH5 status is ”switch unbuckle”, 
SWITCH3, SWITCH6 status is “switch buckle”, 
SWITCH4, SWITCH0 status is “faulty type 2 in switch” without disturbing the other bits.

1) Display the options
2) read the choice
    2.1)if user selects i
    2.2) set the switch j bits in register p and set the switch k bits in register q
    2.3)repeat the above steps until user wants to exit the loop
3) use bitwise operations to set bits

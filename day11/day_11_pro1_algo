//Write a program to do binary search in a sorted array. Program should take input of sorted values and search value. 
//(Make number of elements as configurable value)
//How binary search works is explained below.
Algorithm:
>>Accept the stored data 
>>Accept the serch value
>>size of array/2
>>Get the value of x=array[size of array/2]
>>serch value > x
>>size of array-x
>>push array data to (size of array /2)+1
>>Repeat the steps 3 to 6 untill you found the value.

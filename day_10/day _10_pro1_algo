// Write a function to store "G_Eng_EngineTemperature_uchar" and "G_Eng_EngineRpm_uint" into " G_Msg_EngineInformation_Byte[5u]" as shown below.
//unsigned char G_Eng_EngineTemperature_uchar = 50u ;
//unsigned int G_Eng_EngineRpm_uint = 1000u;
//unsigned char G_Msg_EngineInformation_Byte[5u];

Algorithm:
1.Take from the qustion Unsigned char and unsigned int bits and you can delare
2.Iterate the unsigned char and unsigned int
3.Unsigned char and unsigned int will be store to  unsigned char G_Msg_EngineInformation_Byte[5u]
4.Take an a array for byte 0 to byte 4 and you have to acess those information to G_Msg_EngineInformation_Byte[i].
5.To see the o/p.

//Write a program to Implement ”Selection Sort” using Recursion for given elements (Number elements will vary, so make it as configurable item)
//How Selection sort works is explained below.

Algorithm:
1.We can use recursion depending our requirement and Declare the variables
2.Take i/p from user
3.Now you go for selection sort 
  -->By using iterations(for) you have to compare present and past values until desired ascending order
   -->swap the array(arr[i] and arr[j])
4.Go to main function and find after sort Array elements.
5.To see o/p as ascending order.

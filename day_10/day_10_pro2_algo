//Write a function to store "G_Str_SteeringAngle_sint" to "G_Msg_SteeringInformation_Byte" as shown below.
//signed int CG_Msg_EngineInformation_Byte[i];
//unsigned char G_Msg_SteeringInformation_Byte[3u];"
Algorithm:
1.Declare the variable as G_Str_SteeringAngle_sint as -60
2.WE have to iterate the above variable in 12 times as per qustion
3.Take an a array for byte 0 to byte 2 and you have to acess those information as per qustion
 unsigned char G_Msg_SteeringInformation_Byte[3u]
4.You have to iterate statement 3
5.Note down the result.
